# Exercise 8.8
Show that
$$
a \perp\!\!\perp b,c \mid d
\;\implies\;
a \perp\!\!\perp b \mid d.
$$
### Solution
$$
\begin{aligned}
p(a|b, d) &= \frac{p(a, b, d)}{p(b, d)} \\
&= \frac{1}{p(b, d)} \sum_c p(a, b, c, d) \\
&= \frac{1}{p(b, d)} \sum_c \underbrace{ p(a|b, c, d)}_{=p(a|d)} p(b, c, d) \\
&= \frac{1}{p(b, d)} \sum_c p(a|d) p(b, c, d) \\
&= \frac{p(a|d)}{p(b, d)} \sum_c p(b, c, d) \\
&= \frac{p(a|d)}{p(b, d)} p(b, d) = p(a | d).
\end{aligned}
