# Exercise 8.4
| $a$ | $b$ | $c$ | $p(a,b,c)$ |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:----------:|
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 0.192      |
| 0   | 0   | 1   | 0.144      |

Evaluate the distributions $p(a)$, $p(b\mid c)$, and $p(c\mid a)$ corresponding to the joint distribution given in Table 8.2. Hence show by direct evaluation that  
$$
p(a,b,c) = p(a)\,p(c\mid a)\,p(b\mid c)\,.
$$  
Draw the corresponding directed graph.

## Solution
The graph is (a) -> (c) -> (b).

It's again just calculation like in 8.3, will skip.
