# Exercise 8.6
For the model shown in Figure 8.13, we have seen that the number of parameters required to specify the conditional distribution $p(y \mid x_1, \dots, x_M)$, where $x_i \in \{0,1\}$, could be reduced from $2^M$ to $M+1$ by making use of the logistic sigmoid representation (8.10). An alternative representation (Pearl, 1988) is given by
$$
p(y = 1 \mid x_1, \dots, x_M) = 1 - (1 - \mu_0)\prod_{i=1}^M (1 - \mu_i)^{x_i}
$$
where the parameters $\mu_i$ represent the probabilities $p(x_i = 1)$, and $\mu_0$ is an additional parameter satisfying $0 \le \mu_0 \le 1$. The conditional distribution (8.104) is known as the noisy-OR. Show that this can be interpreted as a “soft” (probabilistic) form of the logical OR function (i.e., the function that gives $y = 1$ whenever at least one of the $x_i = 1$). Discuss the interpretation of $\mu_0$.
### Figure 8.13
A graph comprising $M$ parents $x_1, \dots, x_M$ and a single child $y$.
### (8.10)
$$
p(y = 1 | x_1, \dots, x_M) = \sigma\left(w_0 + \sum_{i = 1}^M w_i x_i \right) = \sigma(w^\top x).
$$
where
$$
\sigma(a) = (1 + \exp(-a))^{-1}
$$
is the logistic sigmoid, $x = (x_0, x_1, \dots, x_M)^\top$ is an $(M + 1)$-dimensional vector of parent states augmented with an additional variable $x_0$ whose value is clamped to $1$, and $w = (w_0, w_1, \dots, w_M)^\top$ is a vector of $M + 1$ parameters.
## Solution
1. Case: $x_1 = x_2 = \dots = x_M = 0$, then
$$
p(y = 1 | x_1 = 0, \dots, x_M = 0) = 1 - (1 - \mu_0) = \mu_0 \geq 0.
$$
2. Case: $x_1 = x_2 = \dots = x_M = 1$, then
$$
p(y = 1 | x_1 = 1, \dots, x_M = 1) = 1 - \underbrace{(1 - \mu_0)\prod_{i = 1}^M (1 - \mu_i)}_{=: S} = 1 - S \leq 1.
$$
3. Case: $x_1 = x_2 = \dots = x_K = 1, x_{K + 1} = x_{K + 2} = \dots = x_{M} = 0$ (or some permutation of that), then
$$
p(y = 1 | x_1 = 1, \dots, x_K = 1, x_{K + 1} = 0, \dots, x_M = 0) = 1 - (1 - \mu_0) \prod_{i = 1}^K (1 - \mu_i) = 1 - S_K \leq 1 - S.
$$

So the probability that we get a $y = 1$ depends on how many $x_i$ are $1$, if none are $1$ then we get $\mu_0$ as a probability otherwise it is in the range $[\mu_0, 1 - S]$.
