# Exercise 8.5
Draw a directed probabilistic graphical model corresponding to the relevance vector machine described by (7.79) and (7.80).

### 7.79
$$
p(\underline{t} \mid \underline{X}, \underline{w}, \beta) = \prod_{n = 1}^N p(t_n \mid x_n, w, \beta^{-1})
$$

### 7.80
$$
p(w \mid \alpha) = \prod_{i = 1}^M \mathcal{N}(w_i \mid 0, \alpha_i^{-1})
$$

## Solution
For 7.79 we have a plate $(x_n) \rightarrow (t_n)$ and $w$ and $\beta^{-1}$ pointing into $(t_n)$.

For 7.80 we have a plate $(\alpha_i^{-1}) \rightarrow (w_i)$.
