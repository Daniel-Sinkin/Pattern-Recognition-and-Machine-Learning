# Exercise
Consider the expectations of these quantities with respect to the data set values, which themselves come from a Gaussian distribution with parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$. It is straightforward to show that
$$
\begin{aligned}
E[\mu_{\operatorname{ML}}] &= \mu, \\
E[\sigma^2_{\operatorname{ML}}] &= \frac{N - 1}{N} \sigma^2
\end{aligned}
$$
so that on average the maximum likelihood estimate will obtain the correct mean but will underestimate the true variance by a factor $\frac{N - 1}{N}$.

# Solution
$$
E[\mu_{\operatorname{ML}}] = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n = 1}^N E[x_n] = \frac{1}{N}NE[x_1] = E[x_1] = \mu.
$$

$$
E[\sigma^2_{\operatorname{ML}}] = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n = 1}^N E[x_n^2 - 2x_n \mu_{\operatorname{ML}} + \mu^2_{\operatorname{ML}}].
$$
