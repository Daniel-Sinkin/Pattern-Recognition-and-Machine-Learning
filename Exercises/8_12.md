# Exercise 8.12
Show that there are
$$
2^{M(M - 1)/2}
$$
distinct undirected graphs over a set of $M$ distinct random variables. Draw the 8 possibilities for the case of $M = 3$.
## Solution
For the drawing, make 3 dots and between the dots there either is an edge or not, you can just iterate through the number of edges: No edges, 1 edge (3 cases), 2 edges (symmetrically consider where there is NO edge) and 3 edges (all edges drawn in).

The proof idea is that there are 
$$
\frac{M(M - 1)}{2}
$$
possible edges, and every edge can either be active or inactive, so we get
$$
2^{M(M - 1)/2}
$$
possibilities.

To see that the number of possible edges is correct note that it's obviously true for $M = 1$, now suppose it is true for an arbitrary but fixed $M \geq 1$ then the number of possible edges ist
$$
\frac{M(M - 1)}{2},
$$
if we add another vertex ($M \rightarrow M + 1$) then we can connect that with each existing node individually, so we have $M$ potential new edges, and nothing changes about the previous ones.
$$
\frac{M(M - 1)}{2} + M = \frac{M^2}{2} - \frac{M}{2} + M = \frac{M^2}{2} + \frac{M}{2} = \frac{(M + 1)M}{2} = \frac{(M + 1)((M + 1) - 1)}{2},
$$
the statement therefore follows inductively.
