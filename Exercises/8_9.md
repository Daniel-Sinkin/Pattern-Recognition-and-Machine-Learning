# Exercise 8.9
Using the d-separation criterion, show that the conditional distribution for a node $X$ in a directed graph, conditioned on all the nodes in the Market blanket, is independent of the remaining variables in the graph.
## Solution
Recall that a Markov blanket of $X$ consists of all parent $P$ of $X$, all children $C$ of $X$ all co-parent $Q$ of $X$, where a co-parent is a parent of a child of $X$ which is not $X$ itself.

Let t be some node and consider any path from t to X

Every path has to either go through the children or the parents of X 

if it goes through a parent we have a chain with an observed node, simplified written as t -> p -> X where p in P

if it goes through a child (node c in C) it either: 1. went through a descendant of c, i.e. t <- c <- X then it it is indepedent because it's a chain, or it went through a parent of c, write p' for it

if it went through a co-parent $q \in Q$ of a child $c \in C$ then the path contains the collider
$$
X \rightarrow c \leftarrow q
$$
because $c$ is observed this collider becomes active, because the path goes through q (which is observed) the path is blocked because of the chain
$$
t \rightarrow q \rightarrow c
$$
