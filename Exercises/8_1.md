# Exercise 8.1
By marginalizing out the variables in order, show that the representation (8.5) for the joint distribution of a directed graph is correctly normalized, provided each of the conditional distributions is normalized.

### 8.5
$$
p(\underline{x}) = \prod_{k = 1}^K p(x_k|\text{pa}_k).
$$

## Solution
We know that the conditional distributions are normalized, i.e.,
$$
Â­\int p(x_k|\text{pa}_k) dx_k = 1
$$
for all $1 \leq k \leq K$, with that we can compute:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\int \dots \int p(\underline{x}) d\underline{x} &= \int \dots \int_{x_2} \int p(x_1, dx_2, \dots, x_K) dx_1 dx_2 \dots dx_K \\
&= \int \dots \int_{x_2} \prod_{k = 1}^K p(x_k|\text{pa}_k) dx_1 dx_2 \dots dx_K \\
&= \int \dots \int_{x_2} p(x_2|\text{pa}_2) \underbrace{\int p(x_1|\text{pa}_1) dx_1 }_{1}dx_2 \dots dx_K \\
&= \int \dots \int_{x_2} p(x_2|\text{pa}_2) dx_2 \dots dx_K \\
&= \dots \\
&= \int p(x_K|\text{pa}_K) dx_K = 1.
\end{aligned}
