# Exercise
Given a set of data points ${ x_n }$, we can define the convex hull to be the set of all points $\mathbf{x}$ given by
$$
\mathbf{x} = \sum_n \alpha_n \mathbf{x}_n
$$
where $\alpha_n \geq 0$ and $\sum_n \alpha_n = 1$. Consider a second set of points ${ y_n }$ together with their corresponding convex hull. By definition, the two sets of points will be linearly separable if there exists a vector $\mathbf{w}$ and a scalar $w_0$ such that $\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x}_n + w_0 > 0$ for all $\mathbf{x}_n$, and $\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{y}_n + w_0 < 0$ for all $\mathbf{y}_n$. Show that if their convex hulls intersect, the two sets of points cannot be linearly separable, and conversely that if they are linearly separable, their convex hulls do not intersect.

# Solution
Let $X := \{x_n\}_n, Y := \{y_m\}_m$ and denote their convex hulls by
$$
\begin{aligned}
C(X) &= \left\{ \sum_n \alpha_n x_n: \alpha_n \geq 0, \sum_n \alpha_n = 1 \right\}, \\
C(Y) &= \left\{ \sum_m \beta_m y_m: \beta_m \geq 0, \sum_m \alpha_m = 1 \right\}.
\end{aligned}
$$

We want to show that
$$
C(X) \cap C(Y) = \emptyset \iff \exists \overline{w}, w_0 : \overline{w} \bullet x_n + w_0 > 0, \overline{w} \bullet y_m + w_0 < 0
$$
for all $x_n \in X, y_m \in Y$. We denote the RHS by $(\operatorname{LS})$.

## $\Leftarrow$

Suppose $X, Y$ are (LS) but there exists $z \in C(X) \cap C(Y)$ then we can write
$$
\sum_n \alpha_n x_n = z = \sum_m \beta_m y_m,
$$
but then
$$
\begin{aligned}
\overline{w} \bullet z + w_0 &= \overline{w} \bullet \left(\sum_n \alpha_n x_n \right) + w_0 \\ 
&= \sum_n \alpha_n (\overline{w} \bullet x_n) + w_0 \\
&= \sum_n \alpha_n (\overline{w} \bullet x_n) + \left(\sum_n \alpha_n \right)w_0 \\
&= \sum_n \alpha_n \underbrace{(\overline{w} \bullet x_n + w_0)}_{> 0} > 0
\end{aligned}
$$
One can similiarly show, using $z = \sum_m \beta_m y_m$ that
$$
\overline{w} \bullet z + w_0 < 0
$$
which is a contradiciton, as such every linearly seperable sets have disjoint convex hull.

## $\Rightarrow$
Note that because $X, Y$ are finite it follows that $C(X), C(Y)$ are compact. The norm is a continuous functions as such
$$
(x, y) := \arg\max_{(x', y') \in X \times Y} ||x' - y'|| \in X \times Y
$$
exist.

Define $\nu := y - x$ and $k_a := \nu \bullet a, k_b \nu \nu \bullet b$. Obviously $k_a < k_b$. Consider the corresponding hyperplanes
$$
H_a := \{\xi : \nu \bullet \xi = k_a\},\qquad H_b := \{\eta : \nu \bullet \eta = k_b\},
$$
then for any $-w_0 \in (k_a, k_b)$ the hyperplane
$$
H_{- w_0} := \{\xi : \nu \bullet \xi = - w_0\}.
$$
It remains to show that $C(X)$ (and therefore $X$) is contained in
$$
H_a^- := \{\xi : \nu \bullet \xi < k_a\}
$$
and similiarly that $C(Y)$ (and therefore Y) is contained in
$$
H_{-w_0}^+ := \{\xi : \nu \cdot \xi > k_b\}
$$
But this follows directly from the linearity of the dot product.
