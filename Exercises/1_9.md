# Exercise
The maximum of a distribution is known as its mode. For a Gaussian, the mode coincied with the mean.

# Solution
This is a bit of a misnomer, what actually coincied with the mean is the minimizer of the function, but for 1d people often use minimum and minimizer interchangeably.
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{d}{dx} \mathcal{N}(x | \mu, \sigma^2) &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}} \frac{d}{dx}\left(-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}(x - \mu)^2\right) \exp\left( -\frac{1}{2\sigma^2} (x - \mu)^2\right) \\
&= \underbrace{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma^2}} }_{> 0}\underbrace{\left(\frac{x - \mu}{\sigma^2}\right)}_{= 0 \iff x = \mu} \underbrace{\exp\left( -\frac{1}{2\sigma^2} (x - \mu)^2\right)}_{> 0} \geq 0
\end{aligned}
$$
this is $0$ if and only if $x = \mu$. At that value we have
$$
\mathcal{N}(\mu | \mu, \sigma^2) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2} (\mu - \mu)^2\right) = (2 \pi \sigma^2)^{-1/2}.
