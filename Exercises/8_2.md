# Exercise 8.2
Show that the property of there being no directed cycles in a directed graph follows from the statement that there exists an ordered numbering of the nodes such that for each node there are no links going to a lower-numbered node.

## Solution
We will show that
$$
\text{Such a numbering exists} \iff \text{There are no directed cycles.}
$$

"$\Rightarrow$" Fix such an ordered numbering $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_K$ such that
$$
(i, j) \in E \implies i < j.
$$
Now suppose there is a directed cycle
$$
x_{\sigma(1)} \rightarrow x_{\sigma(2)} \rightarrow \dots \rightarrow x_{\sigma(N)}
$$
in this graph then it follows that for $1 \leq i < N$
$$
\sigma(i) < \sigma(i + 1)
$$
and
$$
\sigma(1) = \sigma(N)
$$
but this can't be because
$$
\sigma(1) < \sigma(N - 1) < \sigma(N) = \sigma(1)
$$
would lead to a contradiction.

"\Leftarrow" Denote by
$$
V_j := \{x \in V : \text{shortest path from a root node to }x\text{ has length of exactly }j\}
$$
and note that
$$
V = \bigcup V_j
$$
defines a partition of the vertices and of course $V_0$ consists of all root nodes. There exists $R > 0$ such that
$$
\begin{aligned}
V_R \neq \emptyset,&&V_{R + 1} = \emptyset.
\end{aligned}
$$
Obviously there is no directed edge between a node in $V_k$ and a node in $V_s$ when $k > s$, and so this induces a numbering (number the root notes $x_0, \dots, x_{|V_0|}$, the ones in $V_1$ by $x_{|V_0| + 1}, \dots x_{|V_0| + |V_1|}$ so on). This gives a total numbering
$$
x_0 \dots x_{|V|}
$$
where
$$
|V| = \sum_{i = 1}^R |V_i|
$$
because the $(V_i)_i$ define a partition of $V$.
